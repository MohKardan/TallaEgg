# 📘 TallEgg UML Diagrams – Personal Draft

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of **UML diagrams** that represent **my personal understanding and perspective** of the project’s structure, workflows, and relationships.  

These diagrams are **self-authored** and should be treated as **interpretations**, not as official or finalized documentation. They are intended to help me (and potentially others) reason about the system, explore design options, and highlight areas that may need clarification or correction.

- They reflect **my current view** of the project at the time of writing.  
- They are **not guaranteed to be complete or authoritative**.
