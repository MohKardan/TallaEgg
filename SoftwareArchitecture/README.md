# 📘 TallEgg UML Diagrams – Personal Draft

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of **UML diagrams** that represent **my personal understanding and perspective** of the project’s structure, workflows, and relationships.  

These diagrams are **self-authored** and should be treated as **interpretations**, not as official or finalized documentation. They are intended to help me (and potentially others) reason about the system, explore design options, and highlight areas that may need clarification or correction.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
- These diagrams **may contain errors, omissions, or misinterpretations**.  
- They reflect **my current view** of the project at the time of writing.  
- They are **not guaranteed to be complete or authoritative**.  
- Feedback, corrections, and alternative perspectives are **welcome and encouraged**.

## Contents
- **Class Diagrams** – Show entities, attributes, and relationships as I currently understand them.  
- **Sequence Diagrams** – Capture possible flows of interaction between components.  
- **Use Case Diagrams** – Illustrate how I think users and systems interact.  
- **Other Drafts** – Any experimental or exploratory diagrams I created while reasoning about the design.

## Purpose
- To **document my thought process** while analyzing the project.  
- To **make assumptions explicit** so they can be reviewed and challenged.  
- To serve as a **starting point** for discussion, refinement, and alignment with the team.
